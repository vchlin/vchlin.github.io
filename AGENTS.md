# Agent Instructions

## Writing Style

- Use semantic line breaks in prose,
  wrapping at natural clause boundaries
  and aiming for line lengths of around 80 characters.

## Code Style

- Sort imports lexicographically.

## React

- Extract reusable React UI patterns into separate components to avoid duplication.
  Components used only within a single file can stay colocated
  until they grow large enough to warrant their own file.
