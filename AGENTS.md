# Agent Instructions

## Writing Style

- SHOULD use semantic line breaks in prose,
  wrapping at natural clause boundaries
  and aiming for line lengths of around 80 characters.

## Code Style

- SHOULD sort imports lexicographically.

## React

- SHOULD extract reusable React UI patterns into separate components
  to avoid duplication.
- Components used only within a single file MAY stay colocated
  until they grow large enough to warrant their own file.
